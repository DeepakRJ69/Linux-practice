version control system is a tools that helps to track changes in code.
Git is a Version Control System. it is popular, free and open source fast and scalable.

git clone <somelink>

git status

after modify a file we have to follow two step 1 is add and another is commit

untracked file: which file is not track by git (new file).
modify after change or odify (changed)
stage is ready to  commite (add)

unmodified unchanged(unmodify)

Add and Commit:
Add: adds new and changed files in your working diirectory to the Git stageing area
Git  add <file name>
git add .

commit- it is the record of change
git commit -m "some message"


to show the local repo changes into remote we "push"
git push origin main

origin -for github repo (repo)
main-brach


init command:

git init - for initiate any folder into git
git remote add origin <link>
git remote -v to verify remote
git branch to check branch
git branch -M main to rename branch
git push origin main   or git push -u origin main

 Branch Command:
git branch
git branch -M main (to rename)
git checkout <branch name>  to navigate
git branch -b <new branch name>  (to create branch)
git branch -d <branch name>  (to delete branch)


merge:

git diff <branch name to compare>  
git merge <branch name>
way2: PR(pull request):
to manually in git hub we have to do
to download the code from remote to local machine we use the below command: git pull origin main
undo changes: case1: staged changes):
git reset <file name>
git reset

case2: commit changes undo):
git reset HEAD~1

git log (to see all changes log)

CASE3: commited changes (for many commit)
git reset <commit hash>

git reset --hard <commit hash>

fork: it is a rough copy
A fork is a new repository that shares code and visibility setting with the original "upstream"

few IMP command by which I encounter while facing issue:
 git remote add origin https://github.com/DeepakRJ69/Linux-practice
git remote -v
 git pull origin main --allow-unrelated-histories
