Break and fix 1:
create a folder:
change it's permission to 000 through chmod
after that try to open (unable to open )
fix:
check permission of the file
ls -l <file name>
change the permission through chmod 
Added needed permission done.
Break and fix 2:
create user
try to use sudo(superuser do) command 
like : sudo ls 
facing error
went to the sudoers file edit there  for limited access by (visudo)
or we can went to the /etc/sudoers and check the group which have all sudo access and add the user into the "wheel" group.
now I am able to use the sudo command for the user.
